# VIPNewsApp

This project show breaking news from US. to users.
Users can select their favorite news and see that news on favorites page.
If user select a news, it will show the news details on details page.
There is auto-layout on this project. Therefore, news will be shown for every iphone with different size releted with screen size.
When user favorited a new, activityIntaroctor appeared for 0.5 second. Also there is a favorited news counter below.
Some news doesn't have a thumbnail or photo to show.
TableView is created with RxSwift, so it is reactive.
I added two heart to assets file for like and unlike.
I created a color for texts.
Also if users select a favorited news in favorited news page, they route to details page to see details of favorited news.


It can be used scroll view to show bigger text. I didn't use that in this project, because content text is enought to show in a small label.
